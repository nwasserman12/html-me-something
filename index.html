                    <h2>Bradenton, FL</h2>
                    <p>
                    I was born in Bradenton, FL on August 23, 1995. Bradenton is roughly 56 minutes
                    south of Tampa, Fl. Now I don't remember much of anything about Bradenton as I was just a wee 
                    baby during this time. I am told it is a cool little costal city of 56k people. I lived with my mom and dad for a period of time before getting 
                    adopted by my grandparents and moving down to Pinecrest to live with them.

                        My sister and I came to live with my Grandparents in Pinecrest when we were pretty young, she was around 2, I was around 1.
                        Pinecrest was a great neighborhood to grow up in! It is a suburb of Miami, so there was plenty of things to do. Life was never boring.
