                    <h2>Bradenton, FL</h2>
                    <p>
                    I was born in Bradenton, FL on August 23, 1995. Bradenton is roughly 56 minutes
                    south of Tampa, Fl. Now I don't remember much of anything about Bradenton as I was just a wee 
                    baby during this time. I am told it is a cool little costal city of 56k people. I lived with my mom and dad for a period of time before getting 
                    adopted by my grandparents and moving down to Pinecrest to live with them.

                    <p>
                        My sister and I came to live with my Grandparents in Pinecrest when we were pretty young, she was around 2, I was around 1.
                        Pinecrest was a great neighborhood to grow up in! It is a suburb of Miami, so there was plenty of things to do. Life was never boring.
                        A few years later my mother got out of rehab and moved back in with us. It was an interesting dynamic to say the least. I had two moms
                        (my grandma and my mother) and I had an awesome father in my grandfather. We went on so many family trips every summer. My grandparents were 
                        retired so we got to enjoy some of that retired lifestyle by visiting some incredible places. We would pack up the RV and hit the road, visiting
                        National Park after National Park. In total I've been to 47 states and a big part of it was those family trips we took when I was younger. Sports also 
                        became a huge part of my life when I turned 4 years old. I Started out with Soccer, then moved to Baseball. Pretty soon I was into Basketball, Softball, Golf, 
                        Flag Football, Skiing, etc. I spent most of my time outdoors in the hot south Florida sun and it was incredible. When I was 10 life in Pinecrest was over, it was time 
                        for the next adventure, Eagle, CO.

                    <h1>Eagle, CO</h1>
                    <p>
                        Going from hot humid south Florida weather to dry, high elevation, and snowy Colorado was a bit of a change. My Grandfather was the prsident
                        of the Miami Ski Club so naturally he wanted to live in the mountains. The other main reason was to have a small town atmoshphere for us kids to grow up in away from 
                        the hustle and bustle of the big city. My sister was also getting into a lot of trouble so it was almost a fresh start for all of us. Eagle is a small mountain town of around 6k people, located 2 and a half hours west of Denver. It's only a 30 minute drive to one of the best Ski slopes in the country, Vail, CO. 
                        As you can imagine, we spent alot of time on the local ski mountains. Even my grandfather who was in his 70's at the time spent <b>45 days</b> on the mountain each winter. I like to tell him I help keep him young! It was an incredible time in my life, I met some amazing people, 
                        spent even more time outside with sports, hiking the mountains, you name it, but all great things come to an end. After 5 years it was time to move back to Florida as my grandmother was having a hard time breathing in the elevation without the help of Oxygen. We tried to sell the house quickly but 
                        during 2009-2010, it was pretty hard to do so. They didn't want me moving in the middle of the school year so they sent me to live with my Aunt and Uncle until they could sell the house and come down.

                    <h1>Weston, FL</h1>
                    <p>
                        Moving again was not something I was excited for, especially moving in with a new family dynamic. My sister was causing even more troubles in Colorado so she was away at reform boarding school. It was just me now. Weston is a suburb of Ft. Lauderdale and has a very different lifestyle than what I had grown used to. 
                        My Aunt and Uncle were very strict which was also something I wasn't used to. This got me in a lot of trouble when they would check my phone records and see I sent a text 5 minutes into the start of class time. It was an adjustment that's for sure. A few months in my mom got sick. She was on a Cruise at the time when her lungs started filling up with blood.
                        They had to quickly pull into the closest Mexican port to take her to a hospital. From there
                        she was flown back to a local Florida hostpial. After a few tests we found out she had stage 4 Lung cancer. For insurance resons she couldn't be treated in Florida so she flew back to Colorado for treatment. My Grandparents took the house of the market but left me with my aunt and uncle in Fl. It's hard watching someone you love die and not being able to be near them. 
                        She passed away after 4 months, my grandparents finally sold the house shortly after and moved down to Weston. I moved back in with them to finish out my high school days. It was a hard last few years for me.
