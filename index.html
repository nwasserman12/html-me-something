                    <h2>Bradenton, FL</h2>
                    <p>
                    I was born in Bradenton, FL on August 23, 1995. Bradenton is roughly 56 minutes
                    south of Tampa, Fl. Now I don't remember much of anything about Bradenton as I was just a wee 
                    baby during this time. I am told it is a cool little costal city of 56k people. I lived with my mom and dad for a period of time before getting 
                    adopted by my grandparents and moving down to Pinecrest to live with them.

                        My sister and I came to live with my Grandparents in Pinecrest when we were pretty young, she was around 2, I was around 1.
                        Pinecrest was a great neighborhood to grow up in! It is a suburb of Miami, so there was plenty of things to do. Life was never boring.
                        A few years later my mother got out of rehab and moved back in with us. It was an interesting dynamic to say the least. I had two moms
                        (my grandma and my mother) and I had an awesome father in my grandfather. We went on so many family trips every summer. My grandparents were 
                        retired so we got to enjoy some of that retired lifestyle by visiting some incredible places. We would pack up the RV and hit the road, visiting
                        National Park after National Park. In total I've been to 47 states and a big part of it was those family trips we took when I was younger. Sports also 
                        became a huge part of my life when I turned 4 years old. I Started out with Soccer, then moved to Baseball. Pretty soon I was into Basketball, Softball, Golf, 
                        Flag Football, Skiing, etc. I spent most of my time outdoors in the hot south Florida sun and it was incredible. When I was 10 life in Pinecrest was over, it was time 
                        for the next adventure, Eagle, CO.

                    <p>
                        Going from hot humid south Florida weather to dry, high elevation, and snowy Colorado was a bit of a change. My Grandfather was the prsident
                        of the Miami Ski Club so naturally he wanted to live in the mountains. The other main reason was to have a small town atmoshphere for us kids to grow up in away from 
                        the hustle and bustle of the big city. My sister was also getting into a lot of trouble so it was almost a fresh start for all of us. Eagle is a small mountain town of around 6k people, located 2 and a half hours west of Denver. It's only a 30 minute drive to one of the best Ski slopes in the country, Vail, CO. 
                        As you can imagine, we spent alot of time on the local ski mountains. Even my grandfather who was in his 70's at the time spent <b>45 days</b> on the mountain each winter. I like to tell him I helped keep him young!
