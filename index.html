                    <h2>Bradenton, FL</h2>
                    <p>
                    I was born in Bradenton, FL on August 23, 1995. Bradenton is roughly 56 minutes
                    south of Tampa, Fl. Now I don't remember much of anything about Bradenton as I was just a wee 
                    baby during this time. I am told it is a cool little costal city of 56k people. I lived with my mom and dad for a period of time before getting 
                    adopted by my grandparents and moving down to Pinecrest to live with them.

                    <h1>Pinecrest, FL</h1>
                    <p>
                        My sister and I came to live with my Grandparents in Pinecrest when we were both todlers.
                        Pinecrest was a great neighborhood to grow up in! It is a suburb of Miami, so there was plenty of things to do. Life was never boring.
                        A few years later my mother got out of rehab and moved back in with us. It was an interesting dynamic to say the least. I had two moms
                        (my grandma and my mother) and I had an awesome father in my grandfather. We went on so many family trips every summer. My grandparents were 
                        retired so we got to enjoy some of that retired lifestyle by visiting some incredible places. We would pack up the RV and hit the road, visiting
                        National Park after National Park. In total I've been to 47 states and a big part of it was those family trips we took when I was younger. Sports also 
                        became a huge part of my life when I turned 4 years old. I Started out with Soccer, then moved to Baseball. Pretty soon I was into Basketball, Softball, Golf, 
                        Flag Football, Skiing, etc. I spent most of my time outdoors in the hot south Florida sun and it was incredible. When I was 10 life in Pinecrest was over, it was time 
                        for the next adventure, Eagle, CO. 
                    </p>

                    <h1>Eagle, CO</h1>
                    <p>
                        Going from hot humid south Florida weather to dry, high elevation, and snowy Colorado was a bit of a change. My Grandfather was the prsident
                        of the Miami Ski Club so naturally he wanted to live in the mountains. The other main reason was to have a small town atmoshphere for us kids to grow up in away from 
                        the hustle and bustle of the big city. My sister was also getting into a lot of trouble so it was almost a fresh start for all of us. Eagle is a small mountain town of around 6k people, located 2 and a half hours west of Denver. It's only a 30 minute drive to one of the best Ski slopes in the country, Vail, CO. 
                        As you can imagine, we spent alot of time on the local ski mountains. Even my grandfather who was in his 70's at the time spent <b>45 days</b> on the mountain each winter. I like to tell him I help keep him young! My mother and I even developed a tradition of visiting the local gas station on Friday nights. We would get 
                        slushies and just sit in the car and talk. Tell eachother all of our secrets(well almost all, I didn't have the gumption to come out just yet). It was an incredible time in my life, I met some amazing people, 
                        spent even more time outside with sports, hiking the mountains, you name it, but all great things come to an end. After 5 years it was time to move back to Florida as my grandmother was having a hard time breathing in the elevation without the help of Oxygen. We tried to sell the house quickly but 
                        during 2009-2010, it was pretty hard to do so. They didn't want me moving in the middle of the school year so they sent me to live with my Aunt and Uncle until they could sell the house and come down.

                    <h1>Weston, FL</h1>
                    <p>
                        Moving again was not something I was excited for, especially moving in with a new family dynamic. My sister was causing even more trouble in Colorado so she was away at reform boarding school. It was just me now. Weston is a suburb of Ft. Lauderdale and has a very different lifestyle than what I had grown used to. 
                        My Aunt and Uncle were very strict which was also something I wasn't used to. This got me in a lot of trouble when they would check my phone records and see I sent a text 5 minutes into the start of class time. It was an adjustment that's for sure. A few months in my mom got sick. She was on a Cruise at the time when her lungs started filling up with blood.
                        They had to quickly pull into the closest Mexican port to take her to a hospital. From there
                        she was flown back to a local Florida hostpial near where my Aunt and Uncle lived. After a few tests we found out she had stage 4 Lung Cancer. For insurance resons she couldn't be treated in Florida so she flew back to Colorado for treatment. My Grandparents took the house of the market but left me with my aunt and uncle in Fl. It's hard watching someone you love die and not being able to be near them. 
                        She passed away 4 months later. My grandparents finally sold the house shortly after and moved down to Weston. I moved back in with them to finish out High School. It was a hard last few years for me. I didn't really have any friends in Weston, so I was just counting down the days until College.

                    <h1>Time for a fresh start</h1>
                    <h2>Vermillion, SD</h2>
                    <p>
                        South Dakota might seem like a very strange place to decide to go to College but it was the right choice for me. I needed to get out of Florida, and I wanted that small town atomoshpehere I had when we lived in Colorado. College is crazy expensive though so finding a low cost education was a must. That led me to the University of South Dakota in Vermillion. I went in with a thought that I was going to be 
                        an Elementary school teacher. That lasted all of a month. Truth was I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I ended up changing majors more times than I could count. Just trying to find something that would stick. Those first few years of College were amazing though. I finally came out of the closet and was able to just be me which was incredibly freeing. The people were amazing too. Friendly small town atmoshphere. 
                        Vermillion has a population of around 10k which doubles when the University is in session. There weren't thouse outdoor activities I grew to love though. Eventually I had worked my way through all the majors that seemed interesting to me and I decided to try my hand at something new. I decided I wanted to learn Outdoor Education at Black Hills State. I left Vermillion with life long friends and a heart that was no longer broken.

                    <p>
                        Black Hills State University is a small college of around 5k students located in Spearfish, SD, population 11k. It's nestled in the Black Hills and is absolutely gorgeous territory. It was also a 5 hour drive south to Eagle, CO. I was able to go down and visit a few times. Outdoor Education was a degree program for folks who loved the outdoors.
                        The plan was to become a Park Ranger and work in the National Park system, something I loved ever since I was a little girl on those trips. I was able to take some really cool classes that went towards my degree like fly fishing, archery, geology, wilderness firt aid, etc. The coursework was incrdeible, I was signed up to take herpetology, mammology, GIS, Water Safety, and Backpacking my next year, but I found myself enjoying it more as an after work activity. I craved soemthing more intellicually stimulating for a career. 
                        I decided to swtich schools for a third time, crazy I know, and persue the medical field at South Dakota State University.

                    <h1>Brookings, SD</h1>
                    <p>
                        South Dakota State University ulimitly became the school I graduated from. It's located in Brookings, SD the 4th largest city in South Dakota with a population of 24k people. There isn't much to say about the topography, as it's mostly just corn fields, but there were plenty of nice fishing spots nearby. At SDSU I stayed within the medical track for a period of time before deciding I didn't want to do that either. What a hard decision to try and figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life. I decided to make my own degree, general studies with an emphasis in health, science, and Natural Resource management. I had no idea what to do with that, I just wanted to 
                        graduate at some point, and my coursework over the years was very diverse. I joined the Gay Straight Alliance and that's where I met my future wife. Sandy was also a transfer student from North Dakota State University. She studied Sociology with a minor in Criminal Justice. I am so incredibly greatful that I decided to transfer a third time because I found my rock. We spent many weekends at the local Nature Park fishing the day away. She was an Animal Control Officer part time while in school and after graduation it was time for a full time job. Her boss wasn't going to retire anytime soon, but she wanted to stay within the animal care field. She got a job as an Animal Cruelty Investigator in another state. 
                        It was now time to pack up again and move on to the next adventrue.

                    <h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sandy's job brought us to St Louis, a place we now both call home. I finished out my last few courses online while I found a job at a local car dealership, Weber Chevrolet. I work in the BDC department answering internet leads and calling people all day long. I found myself making reports 
                        to track all of our data in the BDC department on my spare time. I made excell sheets that break down avg calls, texts, and emails per day, or even reponse rate per email templates that I would send. I would use this data to help figure out what was working, what wasn't, and how productive I was. I found myself loving the data more than any aspect that was actually my job. 
                        I am not a fan of calling random people all day long, but I love sitting at the computer and working wtih data. I've always loved computers, technology, and problem solving. This lead me to taking codeacademy classes and loving every second of it. After taking several codeacademy classes, I found out about LaunchCode. I had missed the deadline to apply last year but put myself on the email list for when applications opened up again. 
                        Once I found that email that they were accepting for LC101 I applied right away. I can't wait to see where lauchcode can take me and all the incredible things I will learn along the way.
